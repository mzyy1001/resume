## Entrepreneurship Project

- **AI_AB_test XV - "拾伍"**  
  Role: Technical Lead  
  The project uses AI agents to model consumer behavior and enables precise, interpretable A/B testing. It aims to solve pain points in traditional A/B testing, such as high costs, limited sample representativeness, and lack of explainability. The key highlights are:  
  - **Cost-effective**: Costs about 1/6000 to 1/5000 of traditional A/B tests, and 1/1000 to 1/800 of other existing A/B testing methods.  
  - **Dynamic User Behavior Modeling**: Provides higher timeliness and accuracy, responding better to market dynamics.  
  - **Interpretability & Actionable Insights**: Offers actionable analysis with constructional insights and clear explanations for business development.

## Technical Skills  
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Python, Java  
- **Tools**: PyTorch, MMDetection, JUnit, jMock, Prolog  

## Extracurricular Achievements  
- **Olympics of Informatics**  
  Achieved first prize in the National Olympics of Informatics and entered the platinum group in the United States Computing Olympiad.  
- **Mathematics Competitions**  
  Ranked in the top 1% in the American Math Competition (AMC) and top 10 in various university-level competitions.
